You are given a tree with
n
nodes. For each node, you either color it in
0
or
1
.
The value of a path
(u,v)
is equal to the MEX
†
of the colors of the nodes from the shortest path between
u
and
v
.
The value of a coloring is equal to the sum of values of all paths
(u,v)
such that
1≤u≤v≤n
.
What is the maximum possible value of any coloring of the tree?
†
The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:
The MEX of
[2,2,1]
is
0
, because
0
does not belong to the array.
The MEX of
[3,1,0,1]
is
2
, because
0
and
1
belong to the array, but
2
does not.
The MEX of
[0,3,1,2]
is
4
because
0
,
1
,
2
, and
3
belong to the array, but
4
does not.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of nodes in the tree.
The following
n−1
lines of each test case contains
2
integers
ai
and
bi
(
1≤ai,bi≤n,ai≠bi
) — indicating an edge between vertices
ai
and
bi
. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, print the maximum possible value of any coloring of the tree.

Note
In the first sample, we will color vertex
2
in
1
and vertices
1,3
in
0
. After this, we consider all paths:
(1,1)
with value
1
(1,2)
with value
2
(1,3)
with value
2
(2,2)
with value
0
(2,3)
with value
2
(3,3)
with value
1
We notice the sum of values is
8
which is the maximum possible.
