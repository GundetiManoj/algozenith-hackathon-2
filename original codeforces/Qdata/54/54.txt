You are given two arrays
a
and
b
, both of length
n
.
Your task is to count the number of pairs of integers
(i,j)
such that
1≤i<j≤n
and
ai⋅aj=bi+bj
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤n
) — the elements of array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b1,b2,…,bn
(
1≤bi≤n
) — the elements of array
b
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output the number of good pairs.
