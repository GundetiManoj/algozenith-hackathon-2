You are given
n
intervals and
m
points on the number line. The
i
-th intervals covers coordinates
[li,ri]
and the
i
-th point is on coordinate
i
and has coefficient
pi
.
Initially, all points are not activated. You should choose a subset of the
m
points to activate. For each of
n
interval, we define its cost as:
0
, if there are no activated points in the interval;
the coefficient of the activated point with the largest coordinate within it, otherwise.
Your task is to maximize the sum of the costs of all intervals by choosing which points to activate.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤106,1≤m≤106
) — the number of intervals and the number of points.
The following
n
lines of each test case contains two integers
li
and
ri
(
1≤li≤ri≤m
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th interval.
The following line of each test case contains
m
integers
p1,p2,…,pm
(
0≤pi≤109
) — the coefficients of the points.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
106
and the sum of
m
does not exceed
106
.
Output
Output the maximum possible sum of costs of all intervals.

Note
In the first sample, we can activate points
1
and
8
. The sum of costs of all intervals will be
78+30=108
.
In the second sample, we will activate no points. The sum of costs of all intervals will be
0
.
