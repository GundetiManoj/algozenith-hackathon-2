On a permutation
p
of length
n
, we define a bully swap as follows:
Let
i
be the index of the largest element
pi
such that
pi≠i
.
Let
j
be the index of the smallest element
pj
such that
i<j
.
Swap
pi
and
pj
.
We define
f(p)
as the number of bully swaps we need to perform until
p
becomes sorted. Note that if
p
is the identity permutation,
f(p)=0
.
You are given
n
and a permutation
p
of length
n
. You need to process the following
q
updates.
In each update, you are given two integers
x
and
y
. You will swap
px
and
py
and then find the value of
f(p)
.
Note that the updates are persistent. Changes made to the permutation
p
will apply when processing future updates.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤5⋅105
,
1≤q≤5⋅104
) — the length of the permutation and the number of updates.
The second line of input contains
n
integer
p1,p2,…,pn
(
1≤pi≤n
) — the permutation
p
. All elements of
p
are distinct.
The
i
-th of the next
q
lines of input contains two integers
xi
and
yi
(
1≤xi<yi≤n
) — describing the
i
-th update.
Output
After each update, output
f(p)
.
