Input
Ten test cases(given one after another,you have to process all!), Each contains a big design, 'A'-'L' denote the filled grids, '.' denotes the empty grids,see the example. You can assume that the pearl designs used are completely put into the empty grids.
Output
A big design which has no grids that haven't been filled and each pearl design is used one and only one time in it,or 'No solution'(without quotes) if there's no solution.If there are multiple solutions,output any.
