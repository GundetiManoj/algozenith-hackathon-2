Let A and B be two strings made up of alphabets such that A = A[1-n], B = B[1-m]. We say B is a subsequence of A if there exists a sequence of indices i1 < i2 <..m of A such that A[ik] = B[k].
Given B[1-m], a string of characters from some alphabets, B^i is defined as string with the characters of B each repeating i times. For example, (abbacc)^3 = aaabbbbbbaaacccccc. Also, B^0 is the empty string.
Given strings X, Y made up of characters from 'a' - 'z' find the maximum value of M such that X^M is a subsequence of Y.
Input
The first line of the input contains a positive integer t <= 20, denoting the no. of test cases.
The following 2t lines contain the value of X and Y for the cases.
The description of the test cases follow one after the other.
Line 2k contains the value of X for case k; (1 <= k <= t)
Line 2k+1 contains the value of Y for case k; (1 <= k <= t).
The no. of characters in X , Y will be <= 500010.
Output
The output must contain t lines, each line corresponding to a test case. The value on the kth line should be the value of M for the kth pair of X and Y.
