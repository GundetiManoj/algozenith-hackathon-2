Copil Copac is given a list of
n−1
edges describing a tree of
n
vertices. He decides to draw it using the following algorithm:
Step
0
: Draws the first vertex (vertex
1
). Go to step
1
.
Step
1
: For every edge in the input, in order: if the edge connects an already drawn vertex
u
to an undrawn vertex
v
, he will draw the undrawn vertex
v
and the edge. After checking every edge, go to step
2
.
Step
2
: If all the vertices are drawn, terminate the algorithm. Else, go to step
1
.
The number of readings is defined as the number of times Copil Copac performs step
1
.
Find the number of readings needed by Copil Copac to draw the tree.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of vertices of the tree.
The following
n−1
lines of each test case contain two integers
ui
and
vi
(
1≤ui,vi≤n
,
ui≠vi
) — indicating that
(ui,vi)
is the
i
-th edge in the list. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅105
.
Output
For each test case, output the number of readings Copil Copac needs to draw the tree.

Note
In the first test case:
After the first reading, the tree will look like this:
After the second reading:
Therefore, Copil Copac needs
2
readings to draw the tree.
