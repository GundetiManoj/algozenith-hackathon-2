WEB SCRAPPING AND SEARCH BAR PROJECT
This project focuses on web scraping questions from various websites and implementing a search bar using the TF-IDF algorithm. It also includes a user-friendly interface developed using HTML and CSS. The project is hosted on a server to provide online accessibility.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to search and find relevant questions from different websites. The project consists of several components:

Web Scraping: Questions are scraped from various websites using web scraping techniques. Tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium are utilized to extract question data efficiently.

Data Preprocessing: The scraped question data is preprocessed to clean and prepare it for analysis. Irrelevant information, HTML tags, and special characters are removed, and noise in the data is addressed.

TF-IDF Algorithm: The TF-IDF algorithm is implemented to calculate the importance of each word in the question dataset. This allows users to search for keywords and find the most relevant questions. Additional techniques like cosine similarity are employed to enhance search relevance.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface is developed using HTML and CSS. The interface includes a well-designed search bar that enables users to input their search queries and obtain instant results.

Server Hosting: The project is hosted on a server to make it accessible online. Technologies like Flasko and platforms like Render are utilized for server deployment.
